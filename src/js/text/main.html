        <div class="docs--standfirst-shortdesc"><p>A raw perspective into the lives into the lives and beliefs of everyday Americans.</p></div>
        <div class="docs--standfirst-longdesc"><p>In the 18 years since Zed Nelsonâ€™s seminal photography book Gun Nation was published, 500,000 Americans have been killed by firearms in the USA. Half a million people dead - and many more injured. Nelson returns to the people he met, photographs them, and asks why. </p><p> His interviews provide a raw and intimate perspective into the lives and beliefs of everyday Americans. A rare opportunity to hear unguarded interviews with the Americans who use guns every day, as well as the voice of the one left behind after a disaster, this documentary doesn't repeat the same images and polemic we've become immune to. It starts from a place of an outsider's bewilderment and asks gun-lovers 'don't you want a solution too?' </p><p>Zed's two-decade-long rapport with his photo subjects gives him access to discuss difficult questions that they'd normally deny to the liberal media. Zeroing in on the issue of gun registration and the influence of the NRA in particular, it goes beyond the photographic image and tries to find a common ground in the extremes of the gun violence debate. </p></div>
